# Smart Prediction

## Introduction

Smart Prediction(Suggestion) is an Android App which predicts shortcuts for App, Call & SMS based on user's context. It will display a bubble (similar to messenger) and can launch the shortcut. It collects the data from operating system and prepare predictions using clustering algorithms. This is still in research stage and the results might not be highly accurate. Since the app works on in-device, internet connection is not required to work. However, in order to improve my research, collected data is uploaded anonymously. The contact numbers are encrypted using an device specific encryption key and uploaded data does not reveal any contact number.

## Getting Started

1. Launch android studio
2. Click on File, then New and then Import Project Or from the welcome screen of android studio click on Import project. (If you wish to contribute, you can directly link to GitHub)
3. Browse to the directory where you cloned (extracted the zip) research-prediction App and press OK
4. Let Android studio import the project, sync, run and build the Gradle.
5. If Gradle finishes to build without error run the project by clicking on the play button on the tool bar.
6. Wait for a few seconds and the app should start on your device(android phone or emulator)
